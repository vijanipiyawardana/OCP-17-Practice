/* Which of the following code snippets about var compile without issue when used in a
   method? (Choose all that apply.)
   
 * Answer: B, D, E, H
 * 
 * Explaination:
 *  A var cannot be initialized with a null value without a type, but it can be
    assigned a null value later if the underlying type is not a primitive. For these reasons, 
    option H is correct, but options A and C are incorrect. Options B and D are correct as the 
    underlying types are String and Integer, respectively. Option E is correct as this is a valid
    numeric expression. You might know that dividing by zero produces a runtime exception, but
    the question was only about whether the code compiled. Finally, options F and G are incor-
    rect as var cannot be used in a multiple-Â­variable assignment.

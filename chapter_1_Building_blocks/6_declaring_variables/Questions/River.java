        * G.The program prints 50.0 on line 11.
        * H.The program prints 49.0 on line 11.

    Answer: A, D

    Explaination:
    The first compiler error is on line 3. The variable temp is declared as a float, but the
    assigned value is 50.0, which is a double without the F/f postfix. Since a double doesnâ€™t
    fit inside a float, line 3 does not compile. Next, depth is declared inside the for loop and
    only has scope inside this loop. Therefore, reading the value on line 10 triggers a compiler
    error. For these reasons, options A and D are the correct answers.

/*
 * Which of the following statements about var are true? (Choose all that apply.)
        A. A var can be used as a constructor parameter.
        B. The type of a var is known at compile time.
        C. A var cannot be used as an instance variable.
        D. A var can be used in a multiple variable assignment statement.
        E. The value of a var cannot change at runtime.
        F. The type of a var cannot change at runtime.
        G. The word var is a reserved word in Java.

    Answer: B, C, F

    Explaination:
        A var cannot be used for a constructor or method parameter or for an instance or
        class variable, making option A incorrect and option C correct. The type of a var is known
        at compile-­time, and the type cannot be changed at runtime, although its value can change
        at runtime. For these reasons, options B and F are correct, and option E is incorrect. Option
        D is incorrect, as var is not permitted in multiple-­variable declarations. Finally, option G is
        incorrect, as var is not a reserved word in Java.

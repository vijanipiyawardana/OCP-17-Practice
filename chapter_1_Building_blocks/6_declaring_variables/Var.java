/*
 * 9. var is not a reserved word and allowed to be used as an identifier. 
It is considered a reserved type name. A reserved type name means it
cannot be used to define a type, such as a class, interface, or enum.

this code does compile. Java is case sensitive, so Var doesnâ€™t introduce
any conflicts as a class name. 
Naming a local variable var is legal.

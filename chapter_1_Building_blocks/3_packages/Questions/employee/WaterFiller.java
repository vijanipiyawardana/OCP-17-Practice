/**
 Q13.
 Given the following classes, which of the following snippets can independently be inserted in
place of INSERT IMPORTS HERE and have the code compile? (Choose all that apply.)
    A.import aquarium.*;
    B.import aquarium.Water;
      import aquarium.jellies.*;
    C.import aquarium.*;
      import aquarium.jellies.Water;
    D.import aquarium.*;
      import aquarium.jellies.*;
    E.import aquarium.Water;
      import aquarium.jellies.Water;
    F.None of these imports can make the code compile.

 * Answer: A, B, C
 * Explanation:
      Option A is correct because it imports all the classes in the aquarium package
including aquarium.Water. Options B and C are correct because they import Water by
class name. Since importing by class name takes precedence over wildcards, these compile.
Option D is incorrect because Java doesnâ€™t know which of the two wildcard Water classes to
use. Option E is incorrect because you cannot specify the same class name in two imports.

 * Answer: A, E
 * 
 * Explanation: 
 *      Bunny is a class, which can be seen from the declaration: public class Bunny.
        The variable bun is a reference to an object. The method main() is the standard entry
        point to a program. Option G is incorrect because the parameter type matters, not the
        parameter name.

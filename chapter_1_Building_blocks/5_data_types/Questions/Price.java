/**
 *  Given the following class, which of the following lines of code can independently replace
    INSERT CODE HERE to make the code compile? (Choose all that apply.)

    A. int Amount = 0b11;
    B. int amount = 9L;
    C. int amount = 0xE;
    D. int amount = 1_2.0;
    E. double amount = 1_0_.0;
    F. int amount = 0b101;
    G. double amount = 9_2.1_2;
    H. double amount = 1_2_.0_0;

 * Answer: C, F, G
 * 
 * Explaination:
 *  First, 0b is the prefix for a binary value, and 0x is the prefix for a hexadecimal
    value. These values can be assigned to many primitive types, including int and double,
    making options C and F correct. Option A is incorrect because naming the variable Amount
    will cause the System.out.print(amount) call on the next line to not compile. Option
    B is incorrect because 9L is a long value. If the type was changed to long amount = 9L,
    then it would compile. Option D is incorrect because 1_2.0 is a double value. If the type
    was changed to double amount = 1_2.0, then it would compile. Options E and H are
    incorrect because the underscore (_) appears next to the decimal point (.), which is not
    allowed. Finally, option G is correct, and the underscore and assignment usage are valid.
